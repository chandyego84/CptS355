## What is Haskell?
Haskell is a **purely functional programming language**.

- Don't tell the computer what to do, but rather, you tell it what stuff _is_.
    - You express this in the form of functions.
    - The factorial of a number _is_ the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number.

- A function has no side-effects.
    - Can only calculate something and return it as a result (referential transparency).

- Haskell is **Lazy**
    - Won't execute functions unless specifically told otherwise.
    - Think of programs as a series of transformations on data.
